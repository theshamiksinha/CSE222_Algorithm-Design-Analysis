 ## About CSE231

The focus of this course in on the design of algorithms, proofs of correctness and methods to analyse resource requirements of their algorithms. Students learn fundamental algorithmic design paradigms such as greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, divide and conquer, etc. and also learn some more data structures. The later part of the course focuses on the limitations of algorithms. In particular, the theory of NP-completeness.
